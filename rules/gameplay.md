# Gameplay
## Set Up
- Place your `king` in the `king` deploy zone.
- Shuffle your deck
- Allow your opponent to cut your deck
- Decide who will go first (coin flip, die roll, etc.)
- Draw 4 Cards

## Your turn
### Draw
- Draw a card (the player going first does not draw on their first turn)
### Active Phase
Do any of the following actions in any order:
- (Max 1 per turn) Deploy one `piece` from your hand or `hospital` to their deploy zone or `promote` a `pawn` on your opponent's back row
- Activate effects
- Play `actions`
### Move Phase
- Move one `piece`
    - `pieces` may not move on their first turn
    - `pieces` move like their chess piece namesake
    - `pawns` may not perform the 'en passant' or double forward movement on their first move
    - The `king` may not 'castle'
- If moved onto an enemy `piece`, enter combat
- If a `pawn` is moved to the back row, (after combat) they may be `promoted`
#### Combat
- Each player rolls dice as specified by the `attack`/`defence` of their respective `pieces`
- Highest total roll wins
- Losing `piece` is placed in the `hospital` and loses 1 `life`
- If out of lives, the piece is moved to the `grave`
#### Combat with `kings`
Combat involving `kings` is similar to the standard combat except a king is never moved to the `hospital` instead, the `king` loses a `life` and the winning `piece` is moved to the hospital without losing a `life`
### Cleanup Phase
Resolve any effects which occur in the `cleanup` or `at the end of turn`
